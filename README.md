# Computational-Geometry
This repository is devoted for learning computational geometry using two of the top frameworks: Polymake, and CGAL. All the files, are based on the first three chapters of the book "Lectures on Polytopes" from Gunter Ziegler.

## Installation
### Polymake
Please, refer to this [link](https://polymake.org/doku.php/download/start) to install polymake on your computer. After installation, start polymake either from the command line or double-clicking the app icon. Then, open jupyter notebook and check the polymake engine is running. Polymake uses Perl.

### CGAL
Please, refer to this [link](https://www.cgal.org/download.html) to install CGAL on your computer. Do not forget to download the CGAL [examples](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/download/v5.3/CGAL-5.3-examples.tar.xz), they might be useful.

## Motivation
Provide a go-to and understandable set of files for undergraduate or graduate students that want to learn computational geometry.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to Dr. Luis Miguel Torres from Escuela Politecnica Nacional (EPN).
